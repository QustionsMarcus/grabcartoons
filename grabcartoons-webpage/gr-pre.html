<p>GrabCartoons is a comic-summarizing utility. It is modular, and it
is very easy to write modules for new comics.</p>

<table><tr><td bgcolor="yellow"><b>Note:</b> To avoid depriving
free comic web sites of their well-deserved traffic, grabcartoons does
not download the comics to the local machine. Instead, it creates a
page with links to the comics at their original locations. Therefore,
when a page generated by grabcartoons is viewed, the comics are
downloaded from their original pages and not from local
copies. Furthermore, the link to the graphics are extracted from the
comics' web pages, which grabcartoons downloads when it runs. Finally,
each comic in a grabcartoons-generated page is a link to the original
web page.</p></td></tr></table>

<p>You can see a sample of grabcartoons output <a

<p>Here's the list of comics for which we currently have modules:
