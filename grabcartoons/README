grabcartoons

This is the program I use for viewing comics on the web. It's not as
sophisticated as many of the other nice programs out there (check
freshmeat.net, search for "comics" or "strips"), but it does the job
for me. YMMV.

How to use:
-----------

	grabcartoons.pl [--all|--list| comic_id ...]

--list will produce a list of the known id's on stdout

--all will generate a page with all the known comics on stdout

Otherwise, it will produce a page with the given comics on stdout.

Any errors will be included in the generated page.

How to define your own comics:
------------------------------

Subroutines for grabbing comics are defined in the modules/
directory. It also loads any files with .pl extension found in your
$HOME/.grabcartoons/ directory, or on any directories (separated by
colons) contained in the GRABCARTOONS_DIRS environment variable.

A single file can contain more than one subroutine. Each subroutine
must be named get_url_xxx, where xxx is an identifier for the
comic.

Each subroutine must return a three-element array where the first
element is the URL for the image of the current cartoon, the second is
the URL for the main page of the comic (or the one you want linked to
from the image) and the third one is the full name of the comic.

If any of the first two elements is undef, it is considered as an
error, and the string stored in the $err variable is used as an error
message, so you can set it to indicate the source of the error.

If the third return element is undef, the comic's id is used as a
title.

Notes:
------

I developed this program for personal use. If you have any problems,
try looking at the code first. Feel free to email me with any
questions, suggestions or code. I cannot promise any kind of support,
but I would be happy to hear from you if you use grabcartoons.

Enjoy,
