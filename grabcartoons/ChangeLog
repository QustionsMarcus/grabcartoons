2002-08-16  Benjamin Kuperman <kuperman@purdue.edu>

	* grabcartoons.pl (fetch_url): Changed syntax to work with
	older version of LWP::UserAgent.

2002-08-16  Diego Zamboni  <zamboni@users.sourceforge.net>

	* modules/00grabcartoons_output.pl: Moved print_* subroutines from
	the main program to modules/00grabcartoons_output.pl. This way
	it's easier to customize the output of the program.

	* Makefile (install): Added install target, local CERIAS targets.

	* grabcartoons.pl (fetch_url): Added quotes around the URL when
	using an external command.

	*  (coolcatstudio.pl): Removed, the comic doesn't seem to be
	online anymore.
	(gucomics.pl): Removed, the comic doesn't seem to be online
	anymore.

	* grabcartoons.pl (fetch_url,get_line,get_fullpage): Added these
	three subroutines to make it easier to write new
	modules. fetch_url($url) grabs a URL and stores it in a local
	array, and get_line() gets one line at a time. get_fullpage
	returns the complete page as a single string.
	Now it also uses LWP::UserAgent if available, instead of an
	external command.

	* modules/*: Modified all the existing modules to use fetch_url
	and get_line instead of running wget directly.
