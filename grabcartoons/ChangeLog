2003-09-29  Benjamin Kuperman <kuperman@users.sourceforge.net>

	* modules/doonesbury.pl (get_url_dooesbury): Modified the
	script to handle both gif and jpg images as the weekend ones
	tend to be the opposite of the weekday ones.

	script to handle both gif and jpg images as the weekend ones
	tend to be the opposite of the weekday ones.

2003-05-13  Benjamin Kuperman <kuperman@users.sourceforge.net>

	* modules/doonesbury.pl (get_url_dooesbury):  Modified the
	base URL to no longer specify what page (index.htm, index.php,
	etc.) is being used as it appears to keep changing.
	
2003-05-07  Benjamin Kuperman <kuperman@users.sourceforge.net>

	* modules/achewood.pl (get_url_achewood): Updated this module to
	reflect the change from index.html to index.php as well as a new
	search for the comic within the page.

2003-05-02  Benjamin Kuperman <kuperman@users.sourceforge.net>

	* modules/phd.pl (get_url_phd):  Updated this module to reflect

2003-01-19  Diego Zamboni  <zamboni@users.sourceforge.net>

	* modules/bizarro.pl (get_url_bizarro): Fixed this module to get
	the comic from its new location at
	http://www.kingfeatures.com/features/comics/bizarro/about.htm.
	It seems that the new site does some referrer checking, so that
	the image grabcartoons gets is a "image not available"
	message. Maybe I will remove this module in a future version.

2002-08-21  Benjamin Kuperman <kuperman@users.sourceforge.net>

	* modules/little_gamers.pl (get_url_little_gamers): Corrected
	this module to work with the PHP based system they are now

	allow output to be sent to a file instead of stdout, submitted
	by Yanick.

	* grabcartoons.pl: Added a "-f" and "--file" option to allow
	the list of comics to be stored in a file instead of being
	specified on the command line, submitted by Yanick.

	* modules/kevin_and_kell.pl (get_url_kevin_and_kell): Added
	module for "Kevin and Kell", contributed by Yanick.

	* modules/liberty_meadows.pl (get_url_liberty_meadows): Added
	module for "Liberty Meadows", contributed by Yanick.

	* modules/sluggy_freelance.pl (get_url_sluggy_freelance): Added
	module for "Sluggy Freelance", contributed by Yanick.
 
2002-11-20  Diego Zamboni  <zamboni@users.sourceforge.net>

	* grabcartoons.pl: Reworked the options processing code to enable
	option bundling (for example, "-va" instead of "-v -a").
	Changed -V to be an alias for --version and -v to be an alias for
	--verbose (it was the other way around) because it seems to me
	that --verbose is a more frequently-used option.

2002-11-19  Diego Zamboni  <zamboni@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Version 1.5
	
	* LICENSE: Added file.

	* grabcartoons.pl (vmsg): Added a --verbose option to print
	progress messages.

	* modules/sinfest.pl (get_url_sinfest): Fixed it to fetch the page
	and extract the comic URL from it, instead of using a fixed format
	(which, depending on time differences, sometimes resulted in an
	invalid URL).

	* modules/non_sequitur.pl (get_url_non_sequitur): Made it fetch
	the whole page even though the comic URL is fixed.

	* modules/glasbergen.pl (get_url_glasbergen): Made it fetch the
	whole page even tough the comic URL is fixed.

	* modules/real_life_adventures.pl (get_url_real_life_adventures):
	Added module for "Real Life Adventures", contributed by Nick
	Adams.

	"Oddly Enough", contributed by Nick Adams.

	* grabcartoons.pl: Removed "use strict"

2002-08-28  Diego Zamboni  <zamboni@users.sourceforge.net>

	* grabcartoons.pl: Fixed bug in checking $GET_METHOD, which
	resulted in it having value of 0.
	Cleaned up options-processing code (removed specific mention of
	most short options, because GetOptions automatically handles
	abbreviations; modified code layout a little bit)
	Added -w, fixed the remaining warnings.

2002-08-21  Benjamin Kuperman <kuperman@users.sourceforge.net>

	* modules/achewood.pl modules/helen.pl modules/goats.pl
	modules/diesel_sweeties.pl: remove double '/' in image URLs
	and be sure that there is a '/' at the end of a website URL
	that does not list a specific page.

2002-08-21  Diego Zamboni  <zamboni@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Version 1.2

	* modules/00grabcartoons_output.pl (print_header): Removed the
	timestamp from the page <title>, leaving it only on the <h1> at
	the top.

	* modules/sinfest.pl (get_url_sinfest): Fixed a double slash in
	the image URL that was preventing it from getting fetched
	correctly.

2002-08-19  Diego Zamboni  <zamboni@users.sourceforge.net>

	* modules/00grabcartoons_output.pl (print_footer): Removed
	"automatically" from the footer.

	* grabcartoons.pl: Expanded the list of module directories to
	include fully-resolved (without symlinks) locations. This should
	make it OK to link to the grabcartoons binary from somewhere
	else. Also added code to eliminate duplicates from the list of
	directories.
	* Added --version option, rearranged option-handling code, and
	modified the help text a little bit. Renamed --html option to
	--htmllist, to have a more descriptive name.

2002-08-19  Diego Zamboni  <zamboni@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Version 1.1
	
	* grabcartoons.pl: Added --html option to produce an HTML list of
	the comics defined.

2002-08-18  Diego Zamboni  <zamboni@users.sourceforge.net>

	* grabcartoons.pl: Improved command-line option processing, added
	help option.

	* First release on sourceforge.net.

2002-08-16  Benjamin Kuperman <kuperman@users.sourceforge.net>

	* grabcartoons.pl (fetch_url): Changed syntax to work with
	older version of LWP::UserAgent.

2002-08-16  Diego Zamboni  <zamboni@users.sourceforge.net>

	* modules/00grabcartoons_output.pl: Moved print_* subroutines from
	the main program to modules/00grabcartoons_output.pl. This way
	it's easier to customize the output of the program.

	* Makefile (install): Added install target, local CERIAS targets.

	* grabcartoons.pl (fetch_url): Added quotes around the URL when
	using an external command.

	*  (coolcatstudio.pl): Removed, the comic doesn't seem to be
	online anymore.
	(gucomics.pl): Removed, the comic doesn't seem to be online
	anymore.

	* grabcartoons.pl (fetch_url,get_line,get_fullpage): Added these
	three subroutines to make it easier to write new
	modules. fetch_url($url) grabs a URL and stores it in a local
	array, and get_line() gets one line at a time. get_fullpage
	returns the complete page as a single string.
	Now it also uses LWP::UserAgent if available, instead of an
	external command.

	* modules/*: Modified all the existing modules to use fetch_url
	and get_line instead of running wget directly.

2002-08-15  Benjamin Kuperman <kuperman@users.sourceforge.net>

	and Deeper (PhD) cartoon from http://phd.stanford.edu/

	cartoon's title stay if a title was not specified by the current
	module.

2001-02-21  Diego Zamboni  <zamboni@cerias.purdue.edu>

	* First public release.

	* Major changes from my previous internal version:
	  - Now loads modules from separate files.
