grabcartoons
------------
Web page: http://grabcartoons.sourceforge.net/

This is the program I use for viewing comics on the web. It's not as
sophisticated as many of the other nice programs out there (check
freshmeat.net, search for "comics" or "strips"), but it does the job
for me. YMMV.

######################################################################
PLEASE NOTE

To avoid depriving free comic web sites of their well-deserved
traffic, grabcartoons does not download the comics to the local
machine. Instead, it creates a page with links to the comics at their
original locations. Therefore, when a page generated by grabcartoons
is viewed, the comics are downloaded from their original pages and not
from local copies. Furthermore, the link to the graphics are extracted
from the comics' web pages, which grabcartoons downloads when it
runs. Finally, each comic in a grabcartoons-generated page is a link
to the original web page.

Grabcartoons is intended for personal use only, not for providing
public access to web comics.

How to install:
---------------

You need to have either:
        LWP::UserAgent and HTTP::Request modules
     or wget in your path (grabcartoons knows how to use it)
     or lynx or some other utility (modify $XTRN_CMD in grabcartoons.pl)

Other than that, you should be able to just run grabcartoons.pl from the
directory where you unpacked the distribution, and it should
automatically find its modules/ directory.

You can also run "make install", after editing the Makefile to check
the value of PREFIX (or run "make install PREFIX=/some/path".

How to use:
-----------

Usage: ./grabcartoons.pl [ option | comic_id ...]

--all     or -a   generate a page with all the known comics on stdout.
--list    or -l   produce a list of the known comic_id's on stdout.
--htmllist        produce HTML list of known comic_id's on stdout.
--file    or -f   read list of comics from specified file.
--write   or -w   write output to specified file instead of stdout.
--version or -V   print version number
--verbose or -v   be verbose
--help    or -h   print help message.

Otherwise, it will produce a page with the given comics on stdout.

Any errors will be included in the generated page.

How to define your own comics:
------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
PLEASE NOTE: THIS HAS CHANGED COMPLETELY IN VERSION 2.0. If you have
modules written for pre-2.0 grabcartoons, you can use the convert.pl
included in the distribution to semi-automate the conversion. See the
comments at the top of convert.pl for instructions.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Modules are defined in files with .pl extension which define where and how
to fetch the comic.

Each comic definition is a set of pair/value keys assigned as a Perl hashref
to an element of the %COMIC hash. For example:

$COMIC{foxtrot} = {
		   Title => 'Foxtrot',
		   Base => 'http://www.ucomics.com',
		   Page => '{Base}/foxtrot/',
		   Regex => qr!src=\"(http://images\.ucomics\.com/comics/ft/.*\.gif)!i,
		  };

The key used for the %COMIC hash is the "short name" of the comic, and the
valid fields in the hash are:
    Title   => title of the comic
    Page    => URL where to get it
    Regex   => regex to obtain image, must put the image in $1
                  (the first parenthesized group)
    Prepend/Append => strings to prepend or append to $1 before
           returning it. May make use of other fields, referenced
           as {FieldName}
    StaticURL => static image URL to return
    StaticHTML => static HTML snippet to return
    Function  => a function to call. It must return
          ($html, $title, $error) (this is useful for quickly porting
          pre-2.0 comic definitions)
    NoShowTitle => if true, do not display the title of the comic
          (for those that always have it in the drawing)

Precedence (from higher to lower) is Function, StaticURL, StaticHTML,
and Regex (which uses Page, Prepend and Append).

Comic definitions are loaded from the modules/ directory, from your
$HOME/.grabcartoons/ directory, and from any directories (separated by
colons) contained in the GRABCARTOONS_DIRS environment variable.

The easiest way is probably to take one of the existing modules (for
example, foxtrot.pl) and base yours on that.

Notes:
------

I developed this program for personal use. If you have any problems,
try looking at the code first. Feel free to email me with any
questions, suggestions or code. I cannot promise any kind of support,
but I would be happy to hear from you if you use grabcartoons.
